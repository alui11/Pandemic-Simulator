# Pandemic Simulator

My first coding project. An AI written in MATLAB as part of my first programming course. Plays the strategic board game Pandemic using 3 strategic algorithms (compared against a control algorithm which makes random moves) to compare the effectiveness of different strategies. The GUI animates games in progress and displays graphical and tabular data comparing trial runs of each algorithm. The GUI may appear poorly formatted on certain computers.
